# Chatter
Messaging app utilizing FIrebase real-time database to authenticate users, send messages, and receive messages.

To simulate sending and receiving messages, you must create two separate accounts. Send messages from both accounts. They will display in a traditional messages format. 

Please note: GoogleService-info.plist has been removed. In order to utilize authentication & messaging, you will need to set up your own firebase environment.

If there are any questions as to how to set this up, feel free to reach out.
